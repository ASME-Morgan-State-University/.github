# Introduction to the EHPV Competition

The competition MUSASME will be joining is the 2025 - 2026 AMSE E-Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (e-HPVC). The location and date are to be determined. The university expects to fund students' travel and lodging for the duration of the competition. The university will make its decision based on your participation and collaboration with others.

# Expectations of Competition Members
You must have taken the necessary steps to become an official competition member. If you haven't already, consult the [ASME Membership Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esOgyAvslK9edDAgdH88jF85isE4b0UZXAwFwrzXpcg/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure you are up to speed. 

Being a part of the competition team **will be a time commitment**. Over the winter, we will meet every Weekday and Saturday except on holidays. All-hands meetings will be held on Wednesdays. We will plan, research, design using CAD, and program as much as possible. We meet in a hybrid environment, and our setup varies depending on our location within the lab. It would be ideal if you could commit to 4 hours per week. Note that the more time you commit, the more successful we will be as a team. Be engaged with the announcements from team leads via [Teams](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/KBy9SUmouxCur6Yc?ref=Link) and be sure to learn as much as you can! 

For a team mentality, I recommend watching this quick video on the [Ethics of Gracious Professionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rc1Gbn3oms).
