# Introduction to the EHPV Competition [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fr3V214qB0)

The competition MUSASME will be joining is the 2024 - 2025 AMSE E-Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (E-HPV). It will occur at the University of North Carolina—Charlotte from April 26th to 27th. The university will fund ten people to have their travel and lodging covered for the duration of the competition. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE FOOD. The university will decide based on your participation and collaboration with others.

# Expectations of Competition Members
You must have taken the necessary steps to become an official competition member. If you haven't already, consult the [ASME Membership Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esOgyAvslK9edDAgdH88jF85isE4b0UZXAwFwrzXpcg/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure you are up to speed. 

Being a part of the competition team **will be a time commitment**. Over the winter, we will meet every Weekday and Saturday except on holidays. All hands meetings will be on Thursday. We will be planning, researching, CADing, and programming as much as possible. We meet hybrid in Discord and wherever we are set up in a lab (stay tuned on Discord). It would be ideal if you could commit to 4 hours per week. Note the more time you commit, the more successful we will be as a team. Be engaged with the announcements from team leads via GroupMe, [Discord](https://discord.gg/QeHypKaq5s), or email, and be sure to learn as much as you can! 

For a team mentality, I recommend watching this quick video on the [Ethics of Gracious Professionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rc1Gbn3oms). 

With that being said, welcome to the team! Finish reading through this section of this document for the competition rules, and get synced up with the rest of the team!

### Programming
The programming stack is based in C++.
Webframe work needs to be mentioned edventaully.  

# Systems Engineering
System engineering is the philosophy of project management we will use to organize ourselves within this project. It answers the questions: 
- What do we need?
- How does it integrate together?
- How can we prove it works?
You would be short-sighted if you believe that this is just component selection. While it is an aspect, justification of each component, scheduling of milestones, and hitting expectations are just as important. See the video series below to learn more about this process, what we plan to implement, and to get a glimpse into the software we will use to organize our plan. The 2nd link has a system composer tutorial.

# CAD (Computer Aided Design) and Manufacturing
Onshape and SimScale are two powerful cloud-based tools that enhance the design and simulation process. Onshape is a cloud-native CAD platform that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on parametric 3D CAD models from any device with an internet connection. It integrates CAD, data management, and collaboration tools, making it ideal for distributed teams. 

SimScale complements Onshape by providing cloud-based simulation capabilities, including FEA (Finite Element Analysis) and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). This integration allows users to seamlessly import their Onshape models into SimScale for detailed simulations, enabling real-time collaboration and optimization of designs. Together, Onshape and SimScale streamline the design-to-simulation workflow, enhancing productivity and reducing the need for physical prototypes.
